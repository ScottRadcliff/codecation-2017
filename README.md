# Plan `Skip Easter`

This plan (which skips family time because of Easter) is to take a codecation from April 15th - April 20th, which lines up with [DeconstructConf](http://deconstructconf.com/). We will work on our projects from April 15th - April 19th and then attend the conference on April 20 - 21.

The conference is in Seattle, WA. The plan is to take a train from Toledo, OH to Vancover, BC, stay in Vancouver, BC for a few days, and then take a train down to Seattle, WA for the conference. We'll be up for our own to travel back but the best option is probably a one way airline ticket to DTW.

## The Dates

* April 15th - Departure from Toledo
* April 15th - Travel from Toledo to Chicago by train
* April 15th - April 17th - Travel from Chicago to Vancouver by train
* April 17th - April 19th - Stay in Vancouver
* April 19th - Travel from Vancouver to Seattle
* April 19th - April 21st - Stay in Seattle (Deconstruct Conference)
* April 21st - Travel back to Toledo

## Travel

This is the travel plan if we don't want to be married since we will not be around for Easter. The travel on train will require wifi or there will be a lot of wasted time.

### Train from Toledo to Chicago

The route for an Amtrak train from Toledo to Chicago (where we will transfer for Vancouver) is called [Capitol Limited](https://www.amtrak.com/ccurl/280/507/Amtrak-Capitol-Limited-Train-Route-Guide.pdf).

### Train from Chicago to Vancouver

The route for an Amtrack train from Chicago to Vancouver is called [Empire Builder](https://www.amtrak.com/ccurl/229/381/Amtrak-Empire-Builder-Train-Route-Guide.pdf). There are a few other ones but this is not only the cheapest but also has the best scenery as it goes near the Canadian rockies.

### Vancouver stay

I think we should stay at an AirBnb in Vancouver. This will be cheaper and allow us to collaborate better than a hotel room would. We can get around by Uber and/or bike.

### Train from Vancouver to Seattle

The route for an Amtrack train from Vancouver to Seattle is called [Cascades](http://amtrakcascades.com). There is also a bus option that is a bit faster we can check out.

### Seattle stay

Deconstruct recommends staying either at the [Silver Cloud hotel](https://broadway.silvercloud.com/irm/irm.html?g=DECONPAR&o=BROADWAY17) or renting an [AirBnb](https://www.airbnb.com/s/SIFF-Cinema-Egyptian--East-Pine-Street--Seattle--WA--United-States?guests=1&adults=1&children=0&infants=0&place_id=ChIJRYoujsxqkFQRmkplI6z6w40&checkin=04%2F19%2F2017&checkout=04%2F21%2F2017&ss_id=37bqsgla&source=bb&page=1&s_tag=9tPM45qL&allow_override%5B%5D=).

There are also [other hotels](https://www.google.com/maps/search/Hotels/@47.6149034,-122.3261398,16z) available.

### Airline from Seattle to Toledo

## The Benjamins

### Train from Toledo to Vancouver ~ $315/per person

The train from Toledo to Chicago, where we need to transfer does not need to be fancy since it's only a 4.5 hour train ride. If we purchase this seperately, we can get a seat for $35/per person.

The train from Chicago to Vancouver, we will probably want a cabin so we don't have to sleep in our seats. This will allow us to sustain the whole trip. If we purchase this seperately, we can get a cabin for $481 for the room. I believe this covers both tickets but I am unsure.

### Vancouver stay ~ $200/per person

The average cost for a night at an AirBnb is around $70 - $160.

### Train from Vancouver to Seattle ~ $32/per person

### Seattle stay ~ $215/per person

The [Silver Cloud hotel](https://broadway.silvercloud.com/irm/irm.html?g=DECONPAR&o=BROADWAY17) is an average of $197/night. The [AirBnb](https://www.airbnb.com/s/SIFF-Cinema-Egyptian--East-Pine-Street--Seattle--WA--United-States?guests=1&adults=1&children=0&infants=0&place_id=ChIJRYoujsxqkFQRmkplI6z6w40&checkin=04%2F19%2F2017&checkout=04%2F21%2F2017&ss_id=37bqsgla&source=bb&page=1&s_tag=9tPM45qL&allow_override%5B%5D=) is an average of $180/night.

### Airline from Seattle to Detroit ~ $180/per person

The average one way flight from Seattle to Detroit ranges from $160 - $235. We would have to leave after 6pm on the same day of the conference.

### Total travel per person ~ $950/per person

We could reduce this if we do not stay in Vancouver. But it's Vancouver.
